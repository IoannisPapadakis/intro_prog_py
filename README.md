# Introduction to Programming using Python
This is meant to be a short course that helps to start programming in Python. The target audience is meant to be Social Scientists, who have little to no background in programming. There is no need for yet another course on how to learn Python, instead I will select a subset of topics that are likely to be interesting for researchers, give a short introduction and point towards resources where you can learn more. Everybody who comes to class should come up with a small programming project. Personally I use python to download information from the web, handle databases or data analysis/numerical computation. For data analysis R might be better suited due to its large community in the topic. For numerical computation you should take a look at Julia. However, in general many repetitive tasks can be automated in a python script and we'll learn how to do that in the next few weeks.

## Class 0 - Git and installing python
1. Before we actually start, you should make yourself familiar with git and github. Git is a distributed version control system, mainly used for code. Any information regarding the course will be made available here in this [repository](https://github.com/chrished/intro_prog_py). To get familiar with git follow this [tutorial](https://try.github.io)

1.a) As an exercise you should create a private repository on github (make sure to sign up as an academic account if possible so you get unlimited private repositories), clone it to your computer, do some work in it and then push it back to the github server.

2. Installing python is pretty simple. I suggest the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download). It comes with many packages preinstalled and an IDE similar to RStudio. Please install python 3.* 

2.a) exercise

## Class 1 - Getting Started with programming

* why programming in general? 
* why python?
* use cases

* basic intro, define variables, lists and dictionaries
* operators on numbers/strings
* data types

head over to codeacademy to follow a nice structured tutorial (even the free version should be sufficient)

## Class 2 - Getting Started ctd.

* revisit basics 
* functions/methods
* import a package
* numpy/scipy/pandas


## Class 3 - getting closer to actual use cases

* example usages of numpy/scipy/pandas, simple statistics example
* Beautiful Soup and urrlib, simple web scraping example

## Class 4 
* planning actual projects using python, what do you need to learn? what packages do you need?
* start working on it

## Class 5 and 6: Support and Presentation of projects
* work on personal project, help with issues and ultimately each student (group) should present their use case
