* low entry barrier, one of the easiest languages to learn
* huge ecosystem, tons of useful tools readily available

### What is the goal of this class?

* help you get started with programming
* lectures will introduce basic concepts and then let you work on exercises (loosely following [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) and [DataCamp - Learn Python](https://www.datacamp.com/learn-python-with-anaconda) )
* you should plan and execute a little project using Python

### What do we do today?

1. Install Python
2. Run our first program
3. Try out Github

### Install Python

* we will install the Anaconda Distribution, which bundles python with some useful tools
1. go to https://www.anaconda.com/download/
2. download the Python 3.6 Installer
3. follow the installation instructions (just keep the standard)
4. when you are done open 'Spyder' and execute the "Hello World!" program

### Install Git and make a Github account
Git is a version control system, which is ideal to save and track your code

1. install git if not already installed on your computer, see the following [instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
2. checkout [Github](https://github.com/) and make an account
3. follow the introduction at [try.github.io](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
4. make your first repository and push it to Github
